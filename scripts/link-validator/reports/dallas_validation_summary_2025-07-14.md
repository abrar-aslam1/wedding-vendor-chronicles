   - Consider adding fallback contact methods for vendors

3. **Technical Enhancements:**
   - Add rate limiting protection to prevent API blocks
   - Implement retry logic for temporary failures
   - Consider caching validation results for 24-48 hours

## Validation Method

The improved validation uses Instagram's official API endpoint (`/api/v1/users/web_profile_info/`) which provides:
- More reliable results than HTML scraping
- Accurate profile existence detection
- Additional profile metadata (follower count, bio, profile image)
- Better handling of private accounts

## Next Steps

1. Update the database with corrected Instagram handles
2. Implement automated weekly validation runs
3. Create alerts for newly invalid profiles
4. Consider adding website validation alongside Instagram validation
