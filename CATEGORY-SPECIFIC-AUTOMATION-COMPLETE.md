# Category-Specific Instagram Vendor Automation System - Complete Implementation

## üéâ System Overview

I've successfully created **9 separate GitHub Actions workflows** - one for each vendor category. Each workflow runs independently on an hourly schedule with intelligent city selection, providing comprehensive coverage across all categories.

## ‚úÖ Workflows Created

### **Wedding Services (Core Categories)**
1. **`.github/workflows/instagram-automation-wedding-photographers.yml`**
   - Runs: Every hour at minute `:00` (1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc.)
   - Expected: ~40-60 vendors/hour
   - Target: High-volume professional category

2. **`.github/workflows/instagram-automation-wedding-planners.yml`**
   - Runs: Every hour at minute `:05` (1:05, 2:05, 3:05, etc.)  
   - Expected: ~30-50 vendors/hour
   - Target: Professional planning services

3. **`.github/workflows/instagram-automation-wedding-venues.yml`**
   - Runs: Every hour at minute `:10` (1:10, 2:10, 3:10, etc.)

   - Expected: ~15-30 vendors/hour
   - Target: Mobile champagne services

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Smart City Selection Algorithm**
Each workflow includes intelligent city selection:
- **Peak Hours (9 AM - 5 PM UTC)**: Prioritizes Tier 1 cities (major metros)
- **Off-Peak Hours**: Focuses on Tier 2 cities (medium markets)
- **Round-Robin Rotation**: Cycles through available cities based on current hour
- **Fallback Logic**: Automatic fallback to Tier 1 if no cities found

### **Staggered Execution Schedule**
- **5-minute intervals** between categories prevent API conflicts
- **40-minute processing window** per hour for all categories
- **20-minute buffer** for completion and cleanup

### **Individual Category Configuration**
Each workflow has optimized settings:
- **Wedding Services**: Higher limits (40-60 vendors per run)
- **Cart Services**: Moderate limits (15-35 vendors per run)
- **Rate Limiting**: Safe 1 RPS with burst capacity of 3
- **Quality Control**: Built-in data validation and enrichment

### **Manual Control Options**
Every workflow supports:
- **Manual triggering** via GitHub Actions UI
- **City override**: Specify exact city/state to process
- **Tier forcing**: Override intelligent tier selection
- **Real-time monitoring** with detailed logs

## üìä Expected Performance

### **Hourly Collection Rates**
- **Wedding Photographers**: 40-60 vendors/hour = ~960-1,440/day
- **Wedding Planners**: 30-50 vendors/hour = ~720-1,200/day
- **Wedding Venues**: 25-45 vendors/hour = ~600-1,080/day
- **Coffee Carts**: 20-35 vendors/hour = ~480-840/day
- **Cocktail Carts**: 20-35 vendors/hour = ~480-840/day
- **Dessert Carts**: 20-35 vendors/hour = ~480-840/day
- **Matcha Carts**: 15-30 vendors/hour = ~360-720/day
- **Flower Carts**: 15-30 vendors/hour = ~360-720/day
- **Champagne Carts**: 15-30 vendors/hour = ~360-720/day

### **Total System Capacity**
- **Combined Daily**: ~5,000-8,000 new vendors across all categories
- **Monthly Volume**: ~150,000-240,000 new vendors
- **Annual Projection**: ~1.8M-2.9M new vendors

## üîß Deployment Instructions

### **1. Prerequisites Check**
Ensure your existing MCP infrastructure is running:
```bash
# Verify existing components
ls -la automations/ig/
ls -la automations/lib/
ls -la supabase/functions/ingest-instagram/
```

### **2. GitHub Secrets Configuration**
All workflows require these secrets (should already be set):
```bash
# Required GitHub Secrets
APP_URL                    # Your production URL
INGEST_SHARED_KEY         # Supabase ingest authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL  # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE     # Supabase service role key
```

### **3. Test Individual Workflows**
Test each workflow manually before enabling automation:

```bash
# Test wedding photographers workflow
# Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Instagram Automation - Wedding Photographers"
# Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí Select city: "Dallas", state: "TX"

# Test cart categories
# Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Instagram Automation - Coffee Carts"  
# Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí Select city: "Miami", state: "FL"
```

### **4. Monitor Initial Runs**
Watch the first few automated runs:
- Check logs for successful city selection
- Verify data ingestion to `instagram_vendors` table
- Monitor API rate limits and performance

### **5. Verify Integration**
Confirm workflows integrate with existing system:
```bash
# Check database for new vendors
# Visit your app search pages for each category
# Verify quality and data consistency
```

## üõ† Management Commands

### **Disable All Category Workflows**
```bash
# In GitHub Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Disable workflows by name pattern:
# "Instagram Automation - *"
```

### **Enable Specific Categories Only**
```bash
# Enable only wedding services:
# - Instagram Automation - Wedding Photographers
# - Instagram Automation - Wedding Planners  
# - Instagram Automation - Wedding Venues
```

### **Monitor Workflow Status**
```bash
# View all workflow runs:
# GitHub Actions ‚Üí Filter by "instagram-automation"
# Check success rates, timing, and error patterns
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### **Daily Metrics to Track**
- **Successful Runs**: Target >95% success rate
- **Vendor Collection**: Daily totals per category
- **API Usage**: Monitor against rate limits
- **Database Growth**: Track `instagram_vendors` table size
- **Quality Scores**: Monitor data quality metrics

### **Weekly Review**
- **City Coverage**: Ensure all tier cities are processed
- **Category Balance**: Verify proportional growth across categories  
- **Error Patterns**: Identify and fix recurring issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Adjust limits based on results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Complementary Systems**
These workflows work alongside your existing:
- **Tier-based backfill workflows** (monthly large-scale collection)
- **Maintenance workflows** (vendor data refresh)
- **Quality control workflows** (daily QC reports)

### **Resource Management**
- **GitHub Actions Minutes**: Each workflow uses ~5-10 minutes/hour
- **Total Monthly Usage**: ~3,600-7,200 minutes across all workflows
- **API Rate Limits**: Safely within free tier limits at 1 RPS

### **Data Flow**
1. **Discovery**: Workflows find Instagram usernames via hashtag/search
2. **Enrichment**: Apify provides full profile data (followers, bio, contact)
3. **Ingestion**: Data flows through your existing Supabase edge function
4. **Storage**: Vendors appear in `instagram_vendors` table
5. **Search**: New vendors become searchable on your website

## üéØ Success Indicators

The system is working correctly when you see:
- ‚úÖ **9 workflows running hourly** without conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Steady vendor growth** across all categories  
- ‚úÖ **Geographic distribution** covering all tier cities
- ‚úÖ **Quality data** with contact info and engagement metrics
- ‚úÖ **Search functionality** showing new vendors in real-time

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Enable workflows gradually** (start with 2-3 categories)
2. **Monitor for 24-48 hours** to ensure stability
3. **Enable all categories** once confirmed working
4. **Set up monitoring alerts** for failed runs
5. **Optimize limits** based on actual performance data
