# Subcategory Collection Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The vendor collection was failing because subcategories were not being stored properly in the database. The root cause was a unique constraint that prevented multiple entries for the same category/city/state combination.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Forced Fallback Mode (FIXED)**
- The Google vendors edge function had `if (true ||` forcing it to always use fallback data
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Removed the forced fallback condition

### 2. **Unique Constraint Blocking Subcategories (NEEDS MANUAL FIX)**
- Old constraint `unique_vendor_cache_entry` prevents multiple subcategory entries
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS MANUAL DATABASE FIX

### 3. **Daily Request Counter (FIXED)**
- Daily counter wasn't resetting properly
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated progress tracking logic

## Required Manual Fix

**You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Drop the old constraint that blocks subcategories
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS unique_vendor_cache_entry;

-- Ensure the new constraint exists (allows different subcategories)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS vendor_cache_unique_subcategory_idx 
ON vendor_cache (category, city, state, COALESCE(subcategory, ''));
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Second subcategory insertion failed with constraint violation
- ❌ Only one subcategory type stored per category/city/state

### After Manual SQL Fix (Expected):
- ✅ Multiple subcategories can be stored for same category/city/state
- ✅ Collection can proceed with proper subcategory differentiation

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Run the SQL fix above in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **TEST**: Run `node test-final-subcategory.js` to verify fix
3. **RESUME**: Restart vendor collection with `node scripts/collect-all-vendors.js`

## Files Modified

- ✅ `supabase/functions/search-google-vendors/index.ts` - Removed forced fallback
- ✅ `scripts/collect-all-vendors.js` - Fixed daily counter reset
- ✅ `vendor-collection-progress.json` - Reset daily counter to 0

## Collection Status

- **Completed**: 177 searches (Birmingham, Montgomery, partial Mobile)
- **Daily Requests**: Reset to 0/200
- **Ready to Resume**: After manual SQL fix

The collection can resume from where it left off once the database constraint is fixed.
