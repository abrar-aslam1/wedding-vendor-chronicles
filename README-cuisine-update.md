# Cuisine Selection Feature Update

This update adds multiple cuisine types to the catering vendor selection, improving the user experience by allowing users to filter caterers by cuisine type.

## Changes Made

1. **Added New Cuisine Types**: Added multiple cuisine options including Italian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, Japanese, Thai, French, Spanish, and Middle Eastern.

2. **Enhanced UI for Cuisine Selection**: Improved the cuisine selection interface with better labels, descriptions, and visual indicators.

3. **Improved Search Results Display**: Added clear indicators for cuisine-filtered results, including headers and badges on vendor cards.

## Applying the Database Migration

To add the new cuisine types to your database, you need to apply the migration file. There are two ways to do this:

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

If you have the Supabase CLI set up and connected to your project:

```bash
npx supabase migration up
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution

If you don't have the CLI set up or prefer to run the SQL directly:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the following SQL and execute it:

```sql
-- Add additional cuisine types to vendor_subcategories table
INSERT INTO vendor_subcategories (id, name, description, category)
VALUES 
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Italian', 'Italian cuisine featuring pasta, pizza, and more', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Mexican', 'Mexican cuisine with tacos, enchiladas, and traditional dishes', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Indian', 'Indian cuisine with curry, tandoori, and diverse regional dishes', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Chinese', 'Chinese cuisine with stir-fry, dim sum, and regional specialties', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Mediterranean', 'Mediterranean cuisine featuring healthy dishes from Greece, Turkey, and more', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Japanese', 'Japanese cuisine with sushi, ramen, and traditional dishes', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Thai', 'Thai cuisine with flavorful curries, noodles, and aromatic dishes', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'French', 'French cuisine with elegant dishes, pastries, and culinary traditions', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Spanish', 'Spanish cuisine featuring paella, tapas, and regional specialties', 'caterers'),
  (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Middle Eastern', 'Middle Eastern cuisine with falafel, hummus, and traditional dishes', 'caterers')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Testing the Changes

After applying the migration, you should:

1. Navigate to the search page
2. Select "Caterers" as the category
3. Verify that all cuisine options appear
4. Select a cuisine and verify that the search results are filtered correctly
5. Check that the cuisine is displayed on the vendor cards and in the search results header
