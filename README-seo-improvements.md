## Usage Guide

### Using the SEO Components

#### SEO Head Component

```tsx
import { SEOHead } from '@/components/SEO';

// In your page component
<SEOHead
  category="photographers"
  city="New York"
  state="NY"
  subcategory="wedding"
  isHomePage={false}
  totalVendors={20}
  imageUrl="/path-to-image.jpg"
  canonicalUrl="https://findmyweddingvendor.com/photographers/new-york/ny"
/>
```

#### Schema Markup Component

```tsx
import { SchemaMarkup } from '@/components/SEO';

// In your page component
<SchemaMarkup
  category="photographers"
  city="New York"
  state="NY"
  vendor={vendorData}
  vendors={vendorsArray}
  totalListings={20}
  isHomePage={false}
  subcategory="wedding"
/>
```

#### Category FAQ Component

```tsx
import { CategoryFAQ } from '@/components/SEO';

// In your page component
<CategoryFAQ
  category="photographers"
  city="New York"
  state="NY"
  subcategory="wedding"
  className="my-custom-class"
/>
```

#### Breadcrumbs Component

```tsx
import { Breadcrumbs } from '@/components/SEO';

// In your page component
<Breadcrumbs
  category="photographers"
  subcategory="wedding"
  city="New York"
  state="NY"
  vendorName="John Doe Photography"
  className="my-custom-class"
/>
```

### Updating Sitemaps

To generate a new sitemap:

```bash
npm run generate-sitemap
```

To update sitemap dates (to encourage more frequent crawling):

```bash
npm run update-sitemap-dates
```

These commands are also integrated into the build process in netlify.toml.

## SEO Health Monitoring

We've added a script to monitor the SEO health of the website. This script checks:

1. **Sitemap Structure**: Validates the sitemap index and individual sitemaps
2. **Robots.txt Configuration**: Checks if robots.txt is properly configured
3. **Important Pages**: Verifies that important pages are included in the sitemap
4. **Sitemap Accessibility**: Checks if the sitemap is accessible from the live site (when run in production)

To run the SEO health check:

```bash
npm run check-seo-health
```

### Automated Monitoring

To automate the SEO health monitoring, we've created a script that sets up a cron job to run the health check weekly and send email notifications if issues are found:

```bash
# Set up a cron job to run the SEO health check weekly
# and send notifications to the specified email
./scripts/setup-seo-cron.sh your-email@example.com
```

This will:
1. Create a script that runs the SEO health check
2. Set up a cron job to run the script every Sunday at midnight
3. Configure email notifications to be sent if issues are found

You can edit the cron schedule by running `crontab -e` after setup.

## Maintenance Tasks

To keep your SEO in top shape, perform these maintenance tasks regularly:

1. **Update Sitemaps**: Generate new sitemaps when adding new content
   ```bash
   npm run generate-sitemap
   ```

2. **Update Sitemap Dates**: Update sitemap dates to encourage more frequent crawling
   ```bash
   npm run update-sitemap-dates
   ```

3. **Update All Sitemaps**: Run both sitemap tasks in sequence
   ```bash
   npm run update-all-sitemaps
   ```

4. **Check SEO Health**: Monitor the overall SEO health of the site
   ```bash
   npm run check-seo-health
   ```

These tasks are also integrated into the build process in netlify.toml, ensuring that the sitemaps are always up-to-date when the site is deployed.

## Next Steps

To further improve SEO, consider:

1. **Content Expansion**: Create more in-depth guides for each vendor category
2. **Link Building**: Implement a strategy for acquiring quality backlinks
3. **User Experience Improvements**: Reduce bounce rate and increase dwell time
4. **Local SEO**: Further enhance location-specific content and markup
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure perfect mobile experience (Google uses mobile-first indexing)
6. **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor and optimize LCP, FID, and CLS metrics
7. **Regular Audits**: Use tools like Google Search Console, Lighthouse, and Screaming Frog to perform regular SEO audits

By implementing these improvements and maintaining good SEO practices, the Wedding Vendor Chronicles website should see improved rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs) over time.
